- Constant variables may belong to any data type in C.
- They are 'read only variables'
- We can read or scan values in them. (We can use those variables to read values, in scanf)
- We can read value in a constant variable multiple time, with warning only (writing into constant object)
- We can perfrom arithmetic operations on contant variable, and store result in non constant variable

However we cannot modify values of constant variables. We will face errors like
prg7.c:7:10: error: increment of read-only variable ‘x’
         x++;
          ^~
prg7.c:8:11: error: assignment of read-only variable ‘x’
         x = 2;
           ^
