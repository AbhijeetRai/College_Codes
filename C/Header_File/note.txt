(A header file can be used to define functions, which you frequently use).
(So that you can simply import the header file and call the function, whenever needed).
(Instead of defining the same function, again and again).
(Here, I have written a header file(and function inside that) to find factorial of a given integer).


While writing a customised header file in 'C' say, "fact.h".

There are two possible ways to store "fact.h" such that it is visible to any program,
or it can be included or imported in any program. One in the same folder
as that of program (where code is written) or in standard location that is "/usr/include".

Storing the header file fact.h in the same folder where code is written,
will make fact.h visible to all files of that folder only. It will not be visible outside the folder

Note that "/usr/include" will act as global storage, and header file written
there can be imported from any program at any location in the local machine.


On side note ->
To save file at "/usr/include" you need to be logged in as root explicitly. Which you can
do by typing command "sudo -i" on terminal. It will then ask for password. (Chances are)
if you are only user in Linux of your local machine. You just have to enter your password
(password while typing, will not be seen, but type it correctly anyway). You will be logged
in as a root user. Save a header file at "/usr/include" and press "Ctrl + D" to log out(come out)
from root user.


While importing header file from same directory we can use "" (double quotes) only.
While importing header file from global storage we can use <> (angular brackets) and ""
(double quotes as well).
