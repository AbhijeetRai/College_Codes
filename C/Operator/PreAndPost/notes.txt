1.
In operartion ++a
consider function

a = a+1
return a

and there is only one reference of a, everytime



2.
In operation a++
consider function

temp = a
a = a+1
return temp

and there is new refernce of temp everytime.


Steps -
1. Always return reference(same reference for pre) (different for post). "Never return value"
2  and do basic maths for grouping
        Example
        a + b + c
        first find final value for (a+b) after returning reference
        then do (a+b) + c


        a + b + c + d
        firstly find answer and value for (a+b) = say ans
        then ans + c = say ans'
        then put ans' + d
        for final answer

Or

Tip - while performing operartion
- consider basic grouping of variable
- always reference is returned (same in ++a) (different in a++)
