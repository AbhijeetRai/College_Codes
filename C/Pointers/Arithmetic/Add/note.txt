FORMULA for pointer addition

If I have integer pointer, (pointer to an integer) int *ptr.
And if I increment ptr by 1, then it would result in, 

ptr + 1
ptr + 1 * (size of data type of ptr)
ptr + 1 * sizeof(int)
ptr + 1 * 4
ptr + 4   (in bytes)


ptr + 3 =
ptr + 3 * (size of data type of ptr)
ptr + 3 * sizeof(int)
ptr + 3 * 4
ptr + 12 

address is ptr would be added by 12 bytes more. 
(That is 3 integers next)
