int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int *ptr1 = arr;                    //pointer to 0th element of array 
int *ptr2 = &arr[0];                //pointer to 0th element of array 

ptr1 and ptr2 are pointers which point to 0th element of the array. 
But we can also have pointer, which can point to whole array. 
(Although the base address of array, the address of whole array and address of 0th element of array are same).

int (*ptr3)[5] = &arr                     //pointer to whole array of size 5

Pointer to 0th element of array and pointer to whole array are totally different
