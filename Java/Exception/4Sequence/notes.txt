Inside a method, if any exception occurs, that method is responsible to create an exception Object.

After creating exception Object, method handovers that Object to JVM.
JVM will check whether the method contains, any exception handling code.
If method does not contain exception handling code.
JVM terminates the method abnormally and removes its stackframe.

Then JVM identifies caller method and checks whether caller method contains any handling code.
If caller method does not contain any handling code, 
then JVM terminates caller method abnormally and terminates its stackframe.
