If we only write try in our code, we get error like
prg1.java:5: error: 'try' without 'catch', 'finally' or resource declarations
		try {
		^
1 error





Use ->
As studied in 'Sequence' folder if any exception occurs in any method.
JVM checks whether that method has handling code(try - catch).
If the method has try-catch or handling code, method is resumed.
Otherwise method is abnormally terminated and stack frame of method is removed


							Flow of method resumed ?
CheckedException occured with try catch				Yes
UncheckedException occured with try catch			Yes

CheckedExeption occured without try catch			No
UnCheckedException occured wihtout try catch			No




TIP -> 'CHECKED' Exceptions must be caught(try-catch) or declared to be thrown(throws)
---	There is no such rule for 'UNCHECKED' Exception
