//Exceptions are something, which disturb the normal flow of program.
//Exception Handling is "not Repairing" the exception, but providing an 'alternate' to normally execute the program.

//run time exceptions show full path while reporting exception like java.lang.ArithmeticException:

class Demo {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		System.out.println(10 / 0);
	}
}
