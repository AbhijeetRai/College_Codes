Question)
In java, 'super()' is the first line of any kind of constructor, by default. But why ?

->> 
'super()' gives call to default constructor of superclass. 'super()' is at first line of 
any constructor, to initialise variables of superclass then variables of subclass are
initialised (convention).

Inheritance has to happen. But not without initialisation of superclass variables. 
How superclass variables will be inherited, if they are not initialised. Which is why
to initialise superclass variables 'super()' is the first call.
