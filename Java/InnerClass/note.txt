Local variables of METHOD (not outer class), where (static AND Instance) method local inner class is present,
act as final in (static AND Instance) method local "INNER CLASS" only. (Not outside class)

Constructor of normal inner class is always parametrised



Tip-
To see the bytecode of nested class in prg1.java, use 'Water$Tab_Button'
or ' Water\$Fish.class'.
