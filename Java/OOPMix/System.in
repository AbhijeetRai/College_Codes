Explaination of line ->
BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));

BufferedReader has constructor "BufferedReader(Reader in)"

InputStreamReader is child of Reader.
InputStreamReader has constructor "InputStreamReader(InputStream in)".

System.in is static field to hold instance of "InputStream class". Which is initially null, 
but holds InputStream at runtime, with help of method 'initializeSystemClass()' of class System.
