NOTE ->
Golden Rule of the thumb is

If overriding method of child class is throwing a 'checked exception'.(checked exception only)
Then, overridden method of parent class must also throw an exception, which will be in hierarchy of,
checked exception thrown by child class method.

And exception of overridden method of parent class, must be equal to or greater to,
checked exception thrown by child class overridding method.



As long as this rule is not violated, everything will be fine.
