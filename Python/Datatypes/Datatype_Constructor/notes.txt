In data structures like list, tuple or set.
Whenever you pass list, tuple or set in their constructor. Their constructors immediately unpack it.

Whenever a dictionary is passed in the constructor of list, tuple or set. Only the key of the dictionary will be unpacked.


Note-->
Constructors of List, Tuple, Set and Dictionary are desinged to accept only 1 argument
Elements passed to list, tuple and set constructor must be iterable


Generally dictionary can be passed in constructor of Dictionary
or
ls = dict([(7, "MSD"), (10, "Sachin")])
>>> ls
{7: 'MSD', 10: 'Sachin'}


Only dictionary has 4 constructors unlike list, tuple and set having 2 constructors only
