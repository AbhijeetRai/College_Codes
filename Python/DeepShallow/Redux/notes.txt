For a shallow copy of list or tuple, address of nested (present inside list or tuple) element like, 
- integer
- list 
- tuple
- set
- dictionary
will be same, simply on principle "If content is same, address is same in Python"


But in a deep copy of List or tuple, address of all mutable objects(list, set, dictionary) is kept different,
such that if one mutable object change, copy is not disturbed






PS ->
I have not tried for set(only immutable objects)
