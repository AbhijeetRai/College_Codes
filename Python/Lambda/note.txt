Python is dynamically typed language. In Python,
we can pass one function to another function,
we can return one function from another function.

But while doing so (both the tasks of passing and returning functions) we only use the name of function.
Without parentheses.

Example
return function
"NOT" return function()

Because the name of function is address of the first instruction in it.


Passing and returning functions is not possible in Java
