When commands are read from a tty,
the interpreter is said to be in interactive mode.
In this mode it prompts for the next command with the primary prompt,
usually three greater-than signs (>>>);
for continuation lines it prompts with the secondary prompt,
by default three dots (...).
The interpreter prints a welcome message stating its version number
and a copyright notice before printing the first prompt:

example -

>>> the_world_is_flat = True
>>> if the_world_is_flat:
...     print("Be careful not to fall off!")
...
Be careful not to fall off!

explaination -

Python interpreter has 2 prompts
>>> (primary prompt) and ... (secondary prompt)
"">>>" signifies interpreter is ready to take command
while "..." means continuation lines

example

>>> world = True
>>> if world:
...     print("us")
...
us
